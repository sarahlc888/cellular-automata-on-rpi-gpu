## Project description
### Components
- CA representation library
- FAT FS support for reading/writing states
- Hardware
- SPI
- Performance optimization
    - CPU speed ups - enabling cache
    - Fine tuning algorithm using profiler (e.g. test performance using modulo for wrapping vs. ternary conditions)
    - GPU
## Member contribution
A short description of the work performed by each member of the team.

## References
Cite any references/resources that inspired/influenced your project. 
If your submission incorporates external contributions such as adopting 
someone else's code or circuit into your project, be sure to clearly 
delineate what portion of the work was derivative and what portion is 
your original work.

Cellular automata library
- Our WireWorld implementation referenced [this](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/WireWorld.html) description of the cellular automaton (including the embedded GIF of OR, XOR, and AND gates).
- We used the [FAT Filesystem module](http://elm-chan.org/fsw/ff/00index_e.html), CS107E [guide](http://cs107e.github.io/guides/extras/sd_library/) to FatFS, and the example project at `$CS107E/examples/sd_fatfs` to write code to read and write presets. 
- `system.c` and `system.h` from CS107E code
- Consulted past GPU project code from [ahconkey-JoshFrancisCodes-project](https://github.com/cs107e/ahconkey-JoshFrancisCodes-project).
